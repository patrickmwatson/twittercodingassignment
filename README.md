# Twitter Coding Assignment for Applicaster 
# &mdash; By Patrick Watson

This is a simple application that has been completed apon request by Applicaster

## Launch 

In order to execute this android applications simply clone the repository locally, open with Android Studio, and press the 'run' button in the top left corner.

## Tests

In order to execute tests, please find the two .java files located in the 'androidTest' folder. Feel free to add any test scripts as desired.

### Notes:
1. Since one requirement for the application was that it automatically refresh every 10 seconds, it is possible when leaving the app running for even a few minutes that the twitter api access limit can be reached, and the app will no longer work. In that event you may wait for the possibility that twitter restores the service, or please contact me at patrickmwatson@gmail.com to have an updated app sent to you with new a new Twitter Key and Secret.
2. Enjoy!
